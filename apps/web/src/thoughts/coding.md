excerpt: what i believe is the future i want as a softwarer developer
---

ai is making progress fulgurantly fast when it comes to coding and i tried for the longest to keep my identity as a software developer by going slow on ai generated code but seeing a product engineer go through iterations of design and features solely prototyping using cursor and lovable made me question my very usefulness as a coder.
of course i argued back to myself that we need solid code to run a company and that only a human had the power to build that but did i have the skill needed for that? as a junior i felt like i was racing ai progress out of pure fear for my existence.
